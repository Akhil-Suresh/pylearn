	Metaclass
	=========

	Metaclass is the class of the class. A metaclass is a class whose 
	instances are classes.Like an "ordinary" class defines the behavior 
	of the instances of the class, a metaclass defines the behavior of 
	classes and their instances. Principially, metaclasses are defined
	like any other Python class, but they are classes that inherit from 
	"type". Another difference is, that a metaclass is called automatically,
	when the class statement using a metaclass ends
